# Release v1.1.1: The Visual Overhaul

This release is all about modernizing the look and feel of the player. We've completely redesigned the user interface to be sleeker, more professional, and more engaging, using modern design trends like "Glassmorphism".

### ✨ UI/UX Redesign Highlights

*   **Glassmorphism Effect:** The main player and pop-out window now feature a beautiful semi-transparent, blurred background, giving them a modern "frosted glass" appearance.
*   **Icon-Based Controls:** Replaced all text-based buttons (Play/Pause, Pop-out) with clean, universally understood SVG icons.
*   **Modernized Volume Slider:** The volume slider has been redesigned with a dynamic "fill" track that visually represents the current volume, providing better user feedback.
*   **Compact Horizontal Layout:** All player controls have been reorganized into a single, sleek horizontal bar, making the player more compact and professional.
*   **Consistent Pop-out Player:** The pop-out player now shares the exact same modern design as the main player, ensuring a seamless and consistent user experience.
*   **Streamlined Header:** The main application header has been made more compact to save vertical screen space, especially on smaller devices.
