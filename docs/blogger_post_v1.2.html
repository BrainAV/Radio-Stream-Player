    <h2 style="color: #2b6cb0;">Radio Stream Player v1.2: The "Universal Streaming" Update is Here! 🎵🚀</h2>

    <p>It feels like just yesterday we released version 1.1, introducing custom visuals, new themes, and the pop-out
        player. But today, I am incredibly excited to announce the release of <strong>Radio Stream Player v1.2</strong>!
        This is arguably our biggest and most important update yet.</p>

    <p>If you've ever tried to build an audio player for the modern web, you know the struggle: most legacy internet
        radio stations still broadcast over insecure <code>http://</code> streams. But because our application is hosted
        safely on <code>https://</code>, modern browsers simply block these streams with a dreaded "Mixed Content"
        error. It was incredibly frustrating... until now.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 30px;">🛡️ The Magic of the Cloudflare Worker Proxy</h3>
    <p>To finally solve the Mixed Content problem, we built a custom backend proxy using Cloudflare Workers
        (<code>api.djay.ca</code>). Instead of your browser trying (and failing) to connect to old HTTP stations
        directly, our player now silently routes those streams through our blazing-fast worker. The worker fetches the
        insecure radio stream on our behalf and securely pipes it back to you via HTTPS.</p>
    <p><strong>The result?</strong> You can now listen to <em>any</em> radio station in the world, securely, without any
        annoying browser errors!</p>

    <h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 30px;">✨ Live "Now Playing" Track Info</h3>
    <p>But we didn't stop there. Because our Cloudflare proxy is fetching the stream, we built a secondary
        <code>/metadata</code> endpoint that actively extracts the live <strong>ICY Metadata</strong> from the
        broadcast. What does this mean for you?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scrolling Marquee:</strong> The player header now features a sleek "Now Playing" display that shows
            you the exact track and artist name currently playing. If the track name is super long (looking at you,
            progressive trance mixes!), it smoothly scrolls across the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Lock Screen Integration:</strong> We wired this live data directly into the OS Media Session API.
            Now, when you play a station, the actual track name will appear on your smartphone's lock screen, your
            smartwatch, and your desktop media controls!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 30px;">⚙️ Player & UI Refinements</h3>
    <p>We've also taken the time to polish the rest of the experience based on your feedback:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Edit Custom Stations:</strong> You no longer have to delete and re-add a custom station to fix a
            typo. You can now simply hit the new "Edit" button (✎) in the Settings menu to tweak the Name, URL, or Genre
            of any station you've added.</li>
        <li><strong>Pop-out Player Parity:</strong> The pop-out window has been upgraded! It now fully supports the new
            Custom Stations, the secure Cloudflare Proxy routing, and it even features the same scrolling metadata
            marquee as the main player window.</li>
        <li><strong>New Curated Content:</strong> We've expanded our default lineup with fantastic new stations
            including <em>Hirsch Radio Psytrance</em>, <em>Hirsch Radio Progressive</em>, and <em>A State of Trance
                (ASOT)</em>.</li>
    </ul>
