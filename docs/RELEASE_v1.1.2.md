# Release v1.1.2: Personalization & Polish

This release introduces major new personalization features, brings the community closer with feedback channels, and polishes the user experience with new features and important bug fixes.

---

### ✨ Personalization is Here!

You can now make the player truly your own.

*   **Custom Backgrounds:** Have a favorite wallpaper? In the Settings modal, you can now paste any image URL to use it as the player's background.
*   **Curated Presets:** Don't want to hunt for an image? We've added a grid of four high-quality, curated background presets (Default, Cyberpunk, Deep Space, Abstract) that look great with the player's design.

### 🤝 Community & Feedback

*   **Suggest & Report:** We've made it easier to contribute! The Settings modal now includes direct links to suggest a new station or report a broken stream via GitHub.

### 🚀 Other Enhancements

*   **New "Neon" Visualizer:** A new glowing bar visualizer style has been added to the rotation.
*   **OS Media Controls:** The player now integrates with your operating system's media controls (and lock screen) thanks to the Media Session API. You can see the station info and use hardware keys to play, pause, and switch stations.
*   **UX Tweak:** The "Favorite" button is now disabled when the "Show Favorites Only" filter is active to prevent you from accidentally removing the station you're listening to from the list.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a visual glitch with the "Circular" VU meter.
*   Corrected an animation bug on mobile for the "Classic" and "Neon" visualizers.
*   Ensured the Settings modal is fully scrollable on smaller screens.
